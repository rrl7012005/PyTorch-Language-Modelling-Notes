# PyTorch-Language-Modelling-Notes
Notes and code for creating a LLM based on the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, and Sentiment Analysis with RNNs and Transformers. The code was collated from multiple sources from the internet, and the notes were summarized in my own words.

Courses and code learnt from:
